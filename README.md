A C-based simulation tool for brute-force logic. Features three modes: searching for passwords in local text files, performing real-time in-memory brute-force attacks using dynamic memory (malloc), and a 6-digit password generator. Designed for educational purposes to demonstrate file I/O, memory management, and randomization in C.
